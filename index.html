      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am <strong>Andrew Fowose</strong>, a 22yr old senior at Morehouse College from Baltimore, Maryland. I am currently also enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development class At Georgia Institute of Technology. As I round up my senior year, I am preparing myself for life post-graduation.  </p>

      <p>Throughout the next few months, I will gain mastery in Full-Stack Web Development in order to become more competitive on the Finance/Tech Workforce. </p>


      <p>Further down the line in my life - sometime before I die - I want to open a School, a Hospital, and a Restaurant. Hopefully, the work I'm putting in during my 20's will manifest itself greatly in the not-too-distant future.</p>
